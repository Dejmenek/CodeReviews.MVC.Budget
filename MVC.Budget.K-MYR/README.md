 4th ASP.NET Core MVC Project of the C# Academy

## Requirements

:heavy_check_mark: This is an application where you should record personal finance transactions.\
:heavy_check_mark: You should have two linked tables: Transaction and Category.\
:heavy_check_mark: You need to use Entity Framework, raw SQL isn't allowed.\
:heavy_check_mark: Each transaction MUST have a category and if you delete a category all it's transactions should be deleted.\
:heavy_check_mark: You should use SQL Server, not SQLite.\
:heavy_check_mark: You should have a search functionality where I can search transactions by name.\
:heavy_check_mark: You should have a filter functionality, so I can show transactions per category and per date.\
:heavy_check_mark: You need to use modals to insert, delete and update transactions and categories. These operations shouldn't be done in a different page.

## Getting Started

### Required Installation Steps

* Restore NugetPackages
* Insert your SQLServer connection string inside appsettings.json  
* No need to run npm restore as all necessary packages are already bundled
* If the 'SeedData' and 'Auto-Migrate' options inside appsettings.json are 'true', the latest migration is automatically applied to the database and seed data will be inserted
